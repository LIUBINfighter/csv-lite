[中文版本Readme](./README_zh.md)

## Introduction

Keep your mind on track! Don't waste time creating fancy tables.

A plugin designed to view and edit CSV files directly within Obsidian.

## Why another csv plugin?

There are so many csv plugin, why you need this one?

Because I want to keep it **simple and stupid**. 

And keep up with the **newest obsidian api and typings**.

No fancy feature, just open and edit.

## Philosophy

- No fancy UI, SAY NO TO
    - modals
	- sidebar
	- settingTab
	- Readme
	- Online docs & tutorials
    - All functions of the ui components above will be covered in a single File view.
- All in TextFileView/workspace.
- No more pollution to your vault, all metadata store in `./.obsidian/plugins/csv` in json format.
- Every function must be completed within 3 steps:
	1. Click/Hotkey
	2. Input (if needed)
	3. Confirm
- The interface should remain minimal yet functional
- Users shouldn't need to leave their workflow environment
- CSV manipulation should be as natural as text editing.

## Features

- View CSV files in table format
- Edit CSV files within Obsidian
- Supports standard CSV formatting
- Compatible with Obsidian's interface

## Purpose

This plugin enhances Obsidian's functionality by allowing users to work with CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files seamlessly within their vault, eliminating the need to switch between different applications for CSV handling.

## Getting Started
